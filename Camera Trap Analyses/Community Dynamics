View(BCI) #is every row a different site?? 

# NOTE: if want to explore these indices, come up with code to transform CT data into vegan-appropriate data


## Diversity indices 

(H <- diversity(BCI)) #finds Shannon diversity indices for all sites 
(J <- H/log(specnumber(BCI))) #finds Pielou's evenness index for all sites
(R <- renyi(BCI[sample(nrow(BCI),6),])) #Renyi's diversities for a random subset of six sites (higher Renyi diversities = more diverse site)
plot(R) #plot Renyi's diversities for six sites 
(alpha <- fisher.alpha(BCI)) #Fisher's log-series alpha for all sites


## Rarefaction 

# b/c species richness increases with sample size, and difs in richness actually might be caused by difs in sample size, solve problem by rarefying species richness to same number of individuals

quantile(rowSums(BCI)) #number of stems per hectare within data set
Srar <- rarefyl(BCI, min(rowSums(BCI))) #richness for same number of individuals


## Species abundance models 

# fisher's log-series model
k <- sample(nrow(BCI),1) #randomly select a plot 
(fish <- fisherfit(BCI[k,]))
confint(fish)

# preston's log-normal model 
# main challenger to Fisher's log-series - instead of plotting species by frequencies, it bins species into frequency classes of increasing sizes
prestondistr(BCI[k,])


## Ranked abundance distribution 
# alternative approach to species abundance distribution is to plot logarithmic abundances in decreasing order, or against ranks of species
(rad <- radfit(BCI[k,]))


## Species accumulation models 
# study accumulation of species when number of sites increases (similar to rarefaction)
sac <- specaccum(BCI) #Kindt's exact method 
plot(sac, ci.type="polygon", ci.col="yellow")


## Beta diversity
# = diversity along gradients (measure of general heterogeneity: how many more species do you have in a collection of sites compared to an average site?) 
(S <- ncol(BCI)/mean(specnumber(BCI)) - 1)

# alternative - Sorensen index of dissimilarity (to deal with S increasing with number of sites)
beta <- vegdist(BCI, binary=TRUE)
mean(beta)

# more alternatives - all commonly used indices can be found using betadiver()
betadiver(help=TRUE)
z <- betadiver(BCI, "z") #for example
quantile(z)


## Species pool 
# number of unseen species (extrapolate species richness)

specpool(BCI) #studies a collection of sites

estimateR(BCI[k,]) #works with counts of individuals,  can be used with a single site
